simple_js_perceptron
==========

- created by Richard "Greg" Marquez ("G-Money")
- A simple JS program to implement, train, and test a perceptron to perform
AND and OR calculations on two input numbers [0.0 .. 1.0]
- Example usage : node perceptron.js 0.0 1.0
  (this will train the network to calculate AND and OR correctly, then will return the values for 0 AND 1, 0 OR 1)
